# Roadmap

Starting a project with multiple parts like "Client," "LeaseManager," and "TransactionManager" in C# using gRPC is a great choice for building a distributed system. To get started, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Your Development Environment:**
   - Ensure you have Visual Studio installed. You can use either Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code for C# development.
   - Install the gRPC tools for C# by adding the Grpc.Tools NuGet package to your project.

2. **Project Structure:**
   - Organize your project into three separate folders or projects, one for each component: "Client," "LeaseManager," and "TransactionManager."

3. **Define gRPC Services:**
   - In each component, define your gRPC services by creating `.proto` files. These files specify the service methods and their data types. You can use the Protocol Buffers (protobuf) language to define your messages and services.
   - Use the `protoc` compiler to generate C# code from your `.proto` files. This generates client and server code to work with your gRPC service.

4. **Implement gRPC Services:**
   - In each component, implement the gRPC services by creating C# classes that inherit from the auto-generated base classes.
   - Write the business logic for your services, such as handling client requests, managing leases, and processing transactions.

5. **Client Implementation:**
   - In the "Client" component, create a C# application or library that serves as the client for interacting with the "LeaseManager" and "TransactionManager" services.
   - Use the auto-generated gRPC client code to make remote procedure calls (RPCs) to the servers.

6. **Dependency Injection (Optional):**
   - Consider using a dependency injection framework like Microsoft's built-in Dependency Injection or a third-party library like Autofac to manage dependencies within your components.

7. **Testing:**
   - Write unit tests and integration tests for your services to ensure they work correctly.
   - Consider using testing frameworks like NUnit or xUnit.

8. **Logging and Error Handling:**
   - Implement logging and error handling in your services to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

9. **Configuration Management:**
   - Use configuration files or environment variables to configure your application's settings, such as server addresses and other parameters.

10. **Build and Deployment:**
    - Build your project and package it for deployment.
    - Consider containerization with Docker if you plan to deploy your components in containers.

11. **Monitoring and Scaling (Later Stages):**
    - Once your system is up and running, implement monitoring and scaling strategies to ensure reliability and performance.

12. **Documentation:**
    - Create documentation for your project, including API documentation for your gRPC services.

13. **Version Control:**
    - Use a version control system like Git to manage your project's source code and collaborate with others.

14. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
    - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.

15. **Security (Critical):**
    - Implement security best practices, including authentication, authorization, and encryption, especially if your system handles sensitive data.

16. **Error Handling and Recovery:**
    - Implement error handling and recovery strategies to handle failures gracefully.

Remember that building a distributed system is a complex task, and it's crucial to plan and design your architecture carefully. Break down your project into manageable pieces, and gradually implement and test each component. Additionally, consider using tools like gRPC's built-in support for load balancing and service discovery to enhance the reliability and scalability of your system.
